            "PUT - Similar to POST, this method is also used for creating resources, but unlike POST, it is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests will result in exactly one resource with the same state. It replaces the resource if it already exists.\n\n",
            "DELETE - This method is used to remove an existing resource from the server. The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds by deleting the requested resource.\n\n",
            "PATCH - Unlike PUT or POST, which usually replace the entire resource, PATCH allows the client to update only parts of a resource. It is also idempotent like PUT.\n\n",
            "Other - This option includes any other API methods that may be used, such as HEAD, OPTIONS, CONNECT, etc., which are less commonly used but serve specific purposes in communication between client and server. For example, HEAD returns only the headers of a resource without its body, while OPTIONS asks the server about the communication options available for a given URL."
